# Welcome to our Hackathon demo! 

We're **The Experimenters**! <br/>
We experiment with cloud technologies and have one mission:

"`Find out how flexible we are to switch cloud providers .... and have tons of fun doing it!`" 

What questions did we try to answer? 

 * **Containers**: the theory says that if you have a container running on AKS, you can run on GKE and EKS. Is that true? 
 * **Serverless**: serverless offerings like Azure Functions, AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions are considered proprietary, but is that true? Can I easily migrate code from Azure Functions to Google Cloud Functions? 
 * **Cross-cloud Analytics**: we've always wondered if having data on a cloud provider and analytics tools on another provider is feasible, easy and realistic.... so why not try it?
 * **GitOps**: would GitOps tool help with abstracting from a specific Cloud Provider?
